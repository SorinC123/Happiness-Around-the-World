# Happiness Around the World Project

## Project Summary
This project analyzes global happiness trends from 2015 to 2019, using data from the Gallup World Poll, sourced via Kaggle. The study aims to explore the factors influencing happiness across countries and regions, identify patterns, and provide insights into the disparities in life satisfaction worldwide.

## Key Questions
- How does happiness vary across regions, and time?

- What are the influential factors affecting happiness - economic, social, psychological, or environmental?

- Which countries rank highest and lowest in performance?

## Data Overview
The datasets are sourced from Kaggle and contain data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2015-2019 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.
